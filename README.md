# Project Rondeo

A digital poster-board style website for my senior capstone, built as the final project in CS 463 Intro to Web Development. Instead of a standard personal portfolio, this site showcases our team’s “Project Rondeo” capstone at Portland State University.

## Overview

(#overiew)

This one-page website follows the course’s general requirements but deviates in three key areas as approved in my project proposal:

1. **“About” → “Meet the Team”**  
   Introduces all four capstone team members with brief bios rather than a single individual.
2. **“Previous Work” → “Project Details”**  
   Details our sponsor and advisor, outlines project overview, research scope, user base, and resources.
3. **“Projects” → “Project Rondeo”**  
   Presents our capstone work (“Project Rondeo”) in full—mirroring our poster board content for the expo.

### Included:

- Navbar

These features were used to develop this webpage. Features that we did not learn in our class will be discussed in further detail in the resources section below.

## Resources

(#resources)

Resources such as MDN and Bootstrap were learned about in class. MDN was critical to my success. When learning a new concept, I would reference MDN. It provided examaples that showed code in use and if necessary imagery to go along with it.

AnimeJS was a resource recommended by my instructor Caterina Paun. This tool was helpful for animating sections of my webpage. However, due to the limited time, I was unable to employ more than one use case.

The medel link was a subsitute to my initial proposed idea of integrating my own 3D SolidWorks model into the webpage. It's embedded into an "a" element. The link redirects the user to a site that showcases the Rondo 3 model.

The rest of the resources used were for coloring.

## Process

(#process)

I started with creating my elements using bootstrap. This was by far the easiest part of the project. Then I focused on adding CSS to style my webpage. My goal was to add more than just plain white color. Lastly, I spent the majority of my time using JavaScript to add components and further functionality to my site. This was about 80% of my time.

Thanks for checking out my site!
